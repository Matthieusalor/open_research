# Open Research
The purpose of this repo is to share a couple of research I have done in both quantitative finance or data science in general.

Regarding the notebooks I will be posting, you will be able to see the results / comments directly into the GitHub repository.
If you want to play arround with the data, I would recommend you either to download the notebooks and execute it if you have you environment setup. 

Otherwise, I'm recommanding to use the google collab notebooks by following this link: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/. You should be able to Copy/Paste the link of the notebook in my GitHub repositery
